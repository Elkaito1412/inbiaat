#HEY EVERY ONE welcome again
this time i made a cells simulator (kind of) and i liked to share it with you all,
fell free to download the code and modify it , i commented a lot in the code it should be
easy to understand and thank you.
there ara some things i'd like you to know, some features in this code:
	The cells that are made from mitosis have a chance to die (1/20).
	The growth of the cells change from one to another so the mitozis won't be
at the same speed.
	You can move the viruses with the mouse if the mouse is inside the canvas.
	Also the viruses will multiply inside the cell after some time,
and will also multiply when the cell dies.
	I HOPE you ENJOY this.
